# Tbilisi Hack Club: Code of Conduct

## Our Mission & Pledge

Tbilisi Hack Club is dedicated to creating an inclusive, safe, and collaborative environment for every young person passionate about technology. We believe that learning is most effective when it happens in a space of mutual respect, curiosity, and encouragement.

We, as members, volunteers, mentors, and staff of the Tbilisi Hack Club community, pledge to make participation in our club a harassment-free and inspiring experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## 1. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to **all Tbilisi Hack Club participants**, including youth members, mentors, volunteers, staff, and guests. It applies in all club-managed spaces, both physical and digital, including:

* **Physical Events:** Workshops, meetings, hackathons, and social gatherings.

## 2. Our Community Standards

We are a community built on the following principles. We expect all participants to uphold these standards:

* **Be Respectful and Welcoming:** Treat everyone with respect. We are a diverse community, and different viewpoints and experiences are valuable. Welcome new members and help them feel included.
* **Be Collaborative:** The best creations are made together. Share your knowledge, offer constructive feedback, and be open to learning from others. Celebrate each other's successes.
* **Be Patient and Kind:** Learning takes time. Not everyone will have the same level of knowledge. Be patient with others and offer help when you can. Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* **Be Curious and Open-Minded:** Ask questions, experiment, and be open to new ideas. Respect that there are many ways to solve a problem.
* **Prioritize Safety:** Look out for one another. If you see a dangerous situation or someone in distress, please report it immediately to a club mentor or staff member.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* **Harassment & Discrimination:** This includes offensive comments related to personal characteristics (listed in our pledge), deliberate intimidation, stalking, unwelcome photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
* **Bullying:** Any form of bullying, whether verbal, physical, or online, will not be tolerated. This includes personal insults, name-calling, and making threats.
* **Violence and Threats:** Any act or threat of violence towards any person is strictly prohibited.
* **Inappropriate Content:** Sharing or displaying sexually explicit or violent material is not allowed.

## 4. Safety & Interactions with Youth

Because our community includes young people, we have specific rules to ensure their safety:

* **Adult-Youth Interactions:** All interactions between adults (mentors, volunteers, staff) and youth members must be professional, respectful, and focused on educational goals.
* **One-on-One Contact:** One-on-one meetings or communication between an adult and a youth member should be avoided. If a private conversation is necessary, it should be conducted in an open, observable space or with another adult present. Online private messaging should be limited to logistical or educational matters.
* **Physical Contact:** Physical contact should be appropriate to a professional and educational setting (e.g., a handshake or high-five). Any other contact is not permitted.
* **Substance Use:** The possession or use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal substances is strictly forbidden at all Tbilisi Hack Club events and in our online spaces.

## 5. Reporting Violations

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it as soon as possible. Your report will be treated with seriousness and confidentiality.

You can make a report to any **Tbilisi Hack Club Mentor or Staff Member**. These individuals will be clearly identified at events.

When taking a report, the staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other club leaders to ensure your report is managed properly. We will investigate all reports and take appropriate action.

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Anyone asked to stop any unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the Tbilisi Hack Club organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including:

* A verbal warning.
* Temporary or permanent expulsion from an event or online space, without a refund (if applicable).
* A temporary or permanent ban from participating in any future club activities.
* Reporting the incident to the appropriate authorities, such as parents/guardians or law enforcement, if the situation warrants it.
